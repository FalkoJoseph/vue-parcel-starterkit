# vue-parcel-starterkit
> Parcel starterkit for Vue.js with single file components & hot reloading. ðŸŽ‰

`vue-parcel-starterkit` is inspired by [vue-parcel-example](https://github.com/rohitkrai03/vue-parcel-example).
The main difference is that this starterkit supports Vue single file components.

# Common issues

Parcel is still a work in progress, so there could be some issues.
However most of the issues I ran into already have open pull-requests, so they'll be fixed soon.

`configured port 3000 could not be used.`
> You can safely ignore this error message as it still works. There's already [a fix](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/302) being issued.

`Error: read ECONNRESET`
> When you manually refresh the page, it breaks the connection. Hot-reloading works however. There's [a fix](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/320) being issued as of right now.
